Please be aware that this module attempts to match Pathbuilder 2e feats, specials and items to Foundry items, and will not perform perfectly in all cases due to database differences.

WARNING! ! ! I highly, highly recommend creating a new character sheet (or ask the master), because the module is in beta version and its performance is not guaranteed until all bugs are fixed with the next patches.

## Instruction

- Install this module or get your GM to do it in Foundry VTT.

- 1) In *Pathbuilder 2e* choose 'Export Character' => 'Export JSON' (The name may differ depending on whether you are using the browser version or the phone app)

- 2) The app will upload your character data to the pathbuilder website and give you a 6 digit reference number.
